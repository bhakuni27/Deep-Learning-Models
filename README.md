# Deep Learning Models

This repository is a work-in-progress collection of example implementations of fundamental deep learning models. Each model will be presented in a self-contained folder with:

- A Jupyter notebook
- A mini README explaining the model
- Relevant datasets

## Planned Models

- [x] Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- [x] Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- [x] Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- [x] Self-Organizing Map (SOM)
- [x] Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
- [ ] AutoEncoder (AE)

## Getting Started

This repo is currently under development. To follow along:

```
git clone https://github.com/bhakuni27/Deep-Learning-Models.git
cd Deep-Learning-Models
```
