# Deep Learning Models

This repository is a work-in-progress collection of example implementations of fundamental deep learning models. Each model will be presented in a self-contained folder with:

- A Jupyter notebook
- A mini README explaining the model
- Relevant datasets

## Planned Models

- [x] ANN (Artificial Neural Network)
- [x] CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- [x] RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
- [x] SOM (Self-Organizing Map)
- [x] RBM (Restricted Boltzmann Machine)
- [ ] AutoEncoder

## Getting Started

This repo is currently under development. To follow along:

```
git clone https://github.com/bhakuni27/Deep-Learning-Models.git
cd Deep-Learning-Models
```
