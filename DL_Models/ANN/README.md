# Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It's composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized into layers: typically input, hidden, and output layers.

Each neuron takes inputs, applies weights and biases, processes them using an activation function, and passes the output to the next layer. Through backpropagation and optimization (like gradient descent), the network learns to minimize prediction error over time.

ANNs are particularly useful for:
- Classification and regression tasks
- Modeling complex, non-linear relationships
- Working with structured tabular data, images, text, etc.

## Objective

The goal of this notebook is to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a customer will **churn** (leave a service) based on historical behavioral and demographic data.
