# Self-Organizing Map (SOM)

A Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is an unsupervised neural network algorithm designed to project high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional (usually 2D) space, while preserving the topological relationships of the original data. This makes SOMs ideal for **visualizing**, **clustering**, and **discovering patterns** in complex datasets.

Unlike supervised models, SOMs donâ€™t rely on labeled outputs. Instead, they **learn to organize input data** based solely on similarity, making them powerful tools for exploratory data analysis, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

SOMs are widely used for:
- Visualizing high-dimensional data
- Clustering similar observations
- Detecting patterns or anomalies
- Exploratory analysis in customer segmentation, bioinformatics, and more

This notebook demonstrates the use of a Self-Organizing Map to analyze the classic **Wine dataset**, which includes chemical attributes of wines from three different cultivars. The goal is to **map similar wine profiles** onto a 2D grid and reveal natural groupings without using label information during training.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3** and **pip** installed. You can download Python from python.org.

To run this notebook, you'll need the following libraries:
- minisom
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

To install them, run:
```
pip install minisom numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
> NOTE: No dataset download is required as the **Wine dataset** is available via `sklearn.datasets`.
