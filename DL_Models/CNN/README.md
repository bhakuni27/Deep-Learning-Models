# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a specialized type of neural network designed to process and classify visual data. It is particularly powerful in recognizing spatial hierarchies and patterns in images through the use of **convolutional layers**, **pooling**, and **non-linear activations**.

Instead of treating input data as flat vectors, CNNs maintain the spatial structure of images. They learn to detect low-level features such as edges and textures in earlier layers, and more abstract features like shapes and objects in deeper layers. This makes CNNs especially effective for image-based tasks.

CNNs are widely used for:
- Recognizing and classifying objects in images
- Analyzing medical and diagnostic imagery
- Detecting visual patterns and textures
- Handling data with spatial or grid-like structure

The goal of this notebook is to develop a CNN-based **image classification** model using the **Fashion MNIST** dataset, a collection of grayscale images representing clothing items like shirts, shoes, and bags. The model learns to predict the correct clothing category based on visual features extracted from the images.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3** and **pip** installed. If not, you can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

To run this notebook, youâ€™ll need the following libraries:
- tensorflow
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

To install the required libraries, run:

```
pip install tensorflow scikit-learn numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
> **NOTE:** No dataset download is required as **Fashion MNIST** is built into TensorFlow.
